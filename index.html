    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
        Netrax Innovations built the <strong>Talking Calculator</strong> app as a free application.
        This app is provided at no cost and is intended for use as is.
    </p>

    <p>
        This page is used to inform users regarding our policies with the collection, use,
        and disclosure of information if anyone decides to use our application.
    </p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

    <p>
        The Talking Calculator app does <strong>not collect any personally identifiable information</strong>
        directly from users.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, the app uses third-party services that may collect information used to identify you.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

    <p>
        The app uses the following third-party service:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Google AdMob (for displaying advertisements)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Google AdMob may collect and use data such as device information, advertising ID,
        IP address, and interaction data to show personalized or non-personalized ads.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can learn how Google manages data in its advertising products here:

    </p>

    <h2>Cookies</h2>

    <p>
        Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers.
        This app does not use cookies directly, but third-party services like Google AdMob may use cookies
        or similar technologies to improve their services.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>

    <p>
        We value your trust in using our application. Since the app does not collect personal data directly,
        there is no risk of personal data misuse from our side.
    </p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>

    <p>
        This app does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13.
        If you believe that a child has provided personal information through third-party services used in this app,
        please contact us so that necessary actions can be taken.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>
        We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Users are advised to review this page periodically
        for any changes. Changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
    </p>
